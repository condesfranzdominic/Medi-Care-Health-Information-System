## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Step 1: Create Test Data

Run this SQL in Supabase to create test data:

```sql
-- 1. Create a doctor (if not exists)
INSERT INTO doctors (doc_first_name, doc_last_name, doc_email, doc_phone, doc_specialization_id, doc_license_number, doc_experience_years, doc_consultation_fee, doc_status)
VALUES ('John', 'Smith', 'dr.smith@medicare.com', '09201234567', 1, 'LIC-12345', 10, 1500.00, 'active')
RETURNING doc_id;

-- 2. Create a user account for the doctor (use the doc_id from above)
INSERT INTO users (user_email, user_password, user_is_superadmin, doc_id)
VALUES ('doctor@medicare.com', '$2y$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi', false, 1);
-- Password: admin123

-- 3. Create some test appointments for this doctor
INSERT INTO appointments (appointment_id, pat_id, doc_id, service_id, status_id, appointment_date, appointment_time, appointment_duration, appointment_notes)

('2025-10-0000004', 1, 1, 3, 2, '2025-10-25', '11:00:00', 30, 'Completed visit');

-- 4. Create a test schedule
INSERT INTO schedules (doc_id, schedule_date, start_time, end_time, max_appointments, is_available)
VALUES 
(1, '2025-10-27', '08:00:00', '17:00:00', 10, true),

## 🚨 Important Testing Notes

### 1. Doctor Data Isolation
**CRITICAL**: Doctors must ONLY see their own data!

Test this by:
1. Create a second doctor and user account
2. Login as doctor 1, note the appointments
3. Logout, login as doctor 2
4. Verify doctor 2 CANNOT see doctor 1's appointments

### 2. Super Admin Access
Super admins should be able to access doctor routes:
1. Login as super admin
2. Navigate to `/doctor/appointments/today`
3. Should work (but will show super admin's doc_id if they have one)

### 3. Access Control
Test unauthorized access:
1. Logout
2. Try to access `/doctor/appointments/today` directly
3. Should redirect to `/login`

### 4. Appointment ID Format
When creating appointments (via super admin):
- Format should be: `2025-10-0000001` (7 digits)
- Auto-increments each month

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Doctor profile not found"
**Solution**: Ensure the user has a valid `doc_id` in the users table

### Issue: "No patients in dropdown"
**Solution**: Doctor needs to have appointments with patients first

### Issue: "Cannot see appointments"
**Solution**: 
1. Check `doc_id` in session
2. Verify appointments exist for this doctor
3. Check appointment dates

### Issue: "Redirect loop"
**Solution**: Verify `requireDoctor()` is working and session is set
