## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### To Test Current Implementation:

1. **Create test users in database**:
```sql
-- Staff user (link to existing staff member)
INSERT INTO users (user_email, user_password, user_is_superadmin, staff_id) 
VALUES ('staff@medicare.com', '$2y$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi', false, 1);

-- Doctor user (link to existing doctor)
INSERT INTO users (user_email, user_password, user_is_superadmin, doc_id) 
VALUES ('doctor@medicare.com', '$2y$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi', false, 1);

-- Patient user (link to existing patient)
INSERT INTO users (user_email, user_password, user_is_superadmin, pat_id) 
VALUES ('patient@medicare.com', '$2y$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi', false, 1);
```
Password for all: `admin123`

2. **Test login redirects**:
   - Login as staff → should redirect to `/staff/dashboard`
   - Login as doctor → should redirect to `/doctor/appointments/today`
   - Login as patient → should redirect to `/patient/appointments` (not created yet)

3. **Test access control**:
   - Staff should NOT be able to access `/superadmin/dashboard`
   - Doctor should NOT be able to access `/staff/dashboard`
   - Each role should only see their allowed modules

## 🔑 Key Implementation Notes

### Access Control Pattern
```php
// For single role
$auth->requireSuperAdmin();

// For multiple roles
$auth->requireRole(['superadmin', 'staff']);

// Check if user can access
if ($auth->canAccess(['superadmin', 'doctor'])) {
    // Show content
}
```

### Doctor Data Filtering
Always filter by logged-in doctor:
```php
$doctor_id = $auth->getDoctorId();
$stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM appointments WHERE doc_id = :doctor_id");
$stmt->execute(['doctor_id' => $doctor_id]);
```

### Patient Data Filtering
Always filter by logged-in patient:
```php
$patient_id = $auth->getPatientId();
$stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM appointments WHERE pat_id = :patient_id");
$stmt->execute(['patient_id' => $patient_id]);
```
